## how to prepare

### learning

- set a deadline (~30 days is good)
- choose a course and stick with it
- hands-on labs HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
- do a small project from scratch
  - use modules and go beyond basic features
  - experiment with terraform cloud

### exam-specific prep

- find practice exams
  - read docs on shaky topics
- don't discount anything, deprecated features are fair game
- use terraform cloud and terraform enterprise
- have a basic understanding of hashicorp's other products
- use [exam review guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/associate-review?in=terraform/certification) as review
- not hard, but don't underestimate it

## exam logistics and tips

### logistics

- reschedule 48 hours in advance
- test unlocks 30 minutes before appt.
- pre-exam process is cumbersome
  - makes you download a "secure" browser
  - live camera feed
  - scan your environment with webcam
  - no additional monitors or apps running
  - took ~20 minutes before the actual exam
- no lip movements during exam
- mentally prepare for this, bc it stressed me out

### UI

- questions are VERY left-justified
- timer VERY right-justified
- flag feature to mark for review
- minor delay when loading questions

### pace

- 60 minutes, 57 questions
- ~30 minutes to complete first passthrough
- ~10 minutes to review my flags
- ~20 minutes to review EVERYTHING
- try to be faster than 1 question per minute
- don't get stuck, flag and move on
- you'll have time to come back
